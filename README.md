# Welcome to Chat with PDFs

Chat with PDFs is a Python web application hosted on Streamlit, designed to empower users to seamlessly upload multiple PDFs and engage in insightful interactions through a conversational interface that revolves around the content of these PDFs.

## Give It a Try

ðŸ”— To experience the capabilities of Chat with PDFs firsthand, simply navigate to [this link](https://chatwithpdfs.streamlit.app/) and dive into the interactive world of PDF-based conversations.

## Libraries Utilized

The Chat with PDFs project extensively employs the following key libraries:

- **Streamlit**: The web application is built upon the Streamlit framework, facilitating a user-friendly interface.
- **PyPDF2**: PDF content extraction is made possible by PyPDF2's `PdfReader`, enhancing text processing capabilities.
- **HuggingFace**: The `BAAI/bge-small-en` model from HuggingFace is instrumental in embedding text segments and forming a robust vector store.
- **Langchain and ChatOpenAI**: These components leverage the vector store to craft dynamic conversation chains, enabling engaging interactions.

## Workflow

The workflow of Chat with PDFs is as follows:

1. The Streamlit-based web application is both developed and hosted, serving as the entry point for users to submit one or multiple PDF files.
2. Utilizing PyPDF2's `PdfReader`, the application extracts textual content from the uploaded PDFs, subsequently forwarding it to the `CharacterTextSplitter` component.
3. `CharacterTextSplitter` takes charge of segmenting the extracted text into smaller, more manageable chunks, enhancing the subsequent processing steps.
4. The distinguished `BAAI/bge-small-en` model from HuggingFace is harnessed to embed the segmented text chunks, resulting in the creation of a comprehensive vector store.
5. This vector store proves pivotal in the construction of dynamic conversation chains through the combined utilization of Langchain and ChatOpenAI.
